The Problem

As a student, I struggled to find a study timer that:
- ‚úÖ Tracked actual study time (not just intentions)
- ‚úÖ Worked without annoying ads or paywalls
- ‚úÖ Provided insights into my productivity patterns
- ‚úÖ Supported different focus techniques (Pomodoro, custom timers)

Existing apps either bombarded me with ads or locked essential features behind subscriptions.
